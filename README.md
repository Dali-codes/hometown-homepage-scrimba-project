# Hometown homepage - scrimba project

The assignment was to create a hometown homepage on our own, and apply as much as possible from all the concepts we´ve learned and practiced. In particular:

- Adding divs, classes and id´s
- Using flexbox
- Using images for backgrounds
- Checking contrast of colors
- Adding box-shadow and text-shadow
- Embedding different fonts. The pretty font I used in the hero-section is from Vanessa Bays and is called 'A little sunshine'@ http://bythebutterfly.com.
